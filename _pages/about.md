## About Me

I am an observational astronomer and a member of the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) (EHT) collaboration, and have been involved in the project since I was an undergraduate student, back in 2014. My research centers around the collection, calibration and analysis of millimeter-wave radio observations of supermassive black holes. I am a leading contributor of the data calibration and imaging efforts that led to the [first image of a black hole](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/first-ever-image-black-hole-published-event-horizon-telescope-collaboration) released by the EHT in April 2019. My research specialty is [Sagittarius A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way.

Born in Algeria, I spent my childhood in Montreal, Canada, and my teens in the Netherlands. I received a BSc in Physics with a minor concentration in Economics from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in 2015, and an MSc in Astrophysics from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in 2017. I am currently pursuing a PhD degree in Astrophysics at Radboud University under the supervision of Prof. [Heino Falcke](http://www.astro.ru.nl/~falcke/).
